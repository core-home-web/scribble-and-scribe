# Scribble & Scribe - Webflow Export Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a Webflow export project that will periodically receive new exports from Webflow. The project primarily consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Code Style & Conventions

### HTML
- Maintain Webflow-generated HTML structure and data attributes (`data-wf-*`, `data-w-id`, etc.)
- Preserve Webflow class naming conventions (`w-*` classes)
- Keep inline styles and embedded scripts when they're part of Webflow exports
- Document any custom modifications clearly with comments

### CSS
- Preserve Webflow-generated CSS structure
- Maintain CSS custom properties/variables as defined in `scribbleandscribe.css`
- When adding custom styles, use clear naming conventions and avoid conflicts with Webflow classes
- Keep component-specific styles organized

### JavaScript
- Preserve Webflow interactions and scripts
- Custom JavaScript (like canvas drawing) should be clearly separated and documented
- Use modern JavaScript practices for any new code
- Maintain compatibility with Webflow's jQuery-based interactions

## Handling Webflow Exports

### When New Exports Arrive
1. **Review Changes**: Compare new export with current version to identify:
   - New files to add
   - Files that should be overwritten
   - Files that contain custom modifications (preserve these)

2. **File Overwrite Strategy**:
   - **Safe to Overwrite**: Standard Webflow-generated files (HTML, CSS, JS) unless they contain custom modifications
   - **Preserve**: Files with custom code (e.g., canvas drawing functionality in `index.html`)
   - **Archive**: Keep old versions in `old-*` files for reference

3. **Custom Modifications**:
   - Document all custom code additions clearly
   - Use comments to mark custom sections: `<!-- CUSTOM: [description] -->`
   - Keep custom code modular and easy to identify

### File Organization
- HTML files: Root directory
- CSS files: `css/` directory
- JavaScript files: `js/` directory
- Images: `images/` directory
- Archived versions: Keep with `old-` prefix

## Development Guidelines

### Before Making Changes
- Check if the file is Webflow-generated or custom
- Review existing custom modifications
- Ensure changes won't conflict with future Webflow exports

### Code Modifications
- Add clear comments explaining custom code
- Use consistent formatting
- Test changes across different browsers
- Maintain responsive design principles

### Git Workflow
- Commit Webflow exports separately from custom modifications
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Tag major Webflow export versions if needed

## Key Features to Preserve

### Canvas Drawing Functionality
- Located in `index.html` (lines ~213-308)
- Custom canvas drawing with color randomization
- Responsive canvas sizing
- Right-click to clear functionality

### Webflow Interactions
- Preserve all `data-w-*` attributes
- Maintain Webflow slider and tab functionality
- Keep animation triggers intact

## Best Practices

1. **Never modify Webflow-generated code unnecessarily** - changes may be overwritten
2. **Document all custom additions** - makes future exports easier to merge
3. **Test after each export** - ensure custom features still work
4. **Keep backups** - archive important versions before major changes
5. **Use semantic HTML** - maintain accessibility standards

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
- Add custom JavaScript in separate files or clearly marked sections
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

### Updating Content
- For content changes, prefer updating in Webflow and re-exporting
- For quick fixes, document changes clearly

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images before committing
- Minify custom JavaScript/CSS if needed (but preserve originals)
- Use Webflow's built-in optimization features
